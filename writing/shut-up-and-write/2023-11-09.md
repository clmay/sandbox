<!--
I'm at my first Shut Up & Write event in Eugene, Oregon on November 9th, 2023. It's about 6:15 PM.

I am not really sure what I'm doing here. I guess the premise is to spend an hour writing *whatever*. So, I suppose that's what I will do... :P

---

I was thinking about writing some kind of journal of spirituality. So perhaps I will give that a try. Something along the lines of *An Inward Life*.

---

My friend Camille made a costume that a character in one of her dreams was wearing. How charming is that? But most charming of all was the way she transformed when she finally put the finished costume on for the first time. Something seemed to come alive within her, in that moment. Is that Magick?

---

I don't know why I'm so interested in defining all these terms of spirit, spirits, and magic. I wonder what that's about, my drive to define?

---

Mr. Piano Man here seems to be channeling the Ethiopian musical pricess-nun. What was her name again?

---

I wonder how long it will take to actually settle into this motion enough to have something worth writing down. I guess we'll see. One thing's likely—that turn will not be helped by constant self-monitoring or self-consciousness. Then again, I'm not exactly sure how to turn that OFF...

---

I suppose one is perhaps supposed to come to these things with some kind of pre-formed idea. Or at least to be a more practiced improviser than I am at the moment.

---

One thing I could write about would be to tell the story of what happened in the woods in a more imaginative way. What would happen if I gave myself permission to depart from the factual?

---

I am noticing that the way I generally come by ideas about what to write is much more impressionistic than all of this. Usually there is some image I have in mind, or some turn of phrase that animates things.

---

I have the most distinct sense of *dejà vu* right now. Not that I've had this exact experience, precisely, but more that I've written very similar words to all this. I'm sure I probably have, to be honest.

---

Phew. Mr. Piano Guy was getting to be a bit much. Now I have some music of my own playing—much better!

---

Huh?

What is this place? How did I get here?

When I went to sleep...

This morning, when I woke up, I thought everything was normal, until I looked in the mirror. Before I tell you what I saw in the mirror

The lights flickered. Nathaniel felt a familiar vice grip his heart. Behind his ears, his hair pricked up, and a shot of icy blood ran between his shoulder blades. He looked around. No one else seemed to have noticed anything.

"I knew I should have left that bone where I found it," he thought to himself. "Why didn't I leave it alone?"

But he already knew the answer to his own question, just as surely as he already knew something else: he had been followed out of the woods that day. By someone.

Or something.

Nathaniel, though nearly thirty-three years old, still had an air of boyishness about his eyes and mouth. He had always been a rather foolish boy, full of all the follies that boyhood entails. Nonetheless, despite his age and demeanor, his dark hair was already thinning, and his face marked with lines. You see, a place leaves its mark on one who travels in it, and Nathaniel's place was the world between worlds.

A low growl issued from the dark corner where Nathaniel sat alone. The lights flickered again. Nathaniel looked around. He always wondered how others failed to notice such things. But then again, not many choose to go looking.

"Time to get out of here..." he thought to himself. "Time to feed her majesty, anyway," thinking fondly of his wilderhund at home. Still, he stifled a shiver as he gathered up his things and headed for the door.

When he arrived home, the fire was only embers, and the hearth was cold. He placed a ball of dried moss in the fireplace, and lifted a terrarium from the mantle.

"Come on, you," he implored. The little eft yawned sleepily and clambered up the side of the glass...

Did the MDN docs intro tutorial for `WebExtension`s. Didn't learn terribly much, but did learn about the `manifest.json` format, and how to use Firefox's `about:debugging` to temporarily load unpublished extensions for testing. So that's good, I guess.

...

## Brainstorming

OK, as I've looked into the `WebExtension` and browser `History` APIs, I think I've realized that the history does not include sufficient detail to reconstruct the actual browsing journey for the user. I think this means that the extension will have to actually record the data itself, throughout the browsing session. This might not be terrible, because it will give absolute control over the structure of the collected data. However, this might mean that there are a lot of low-level details to sort out.

...

Should the UI be part of the browser extension? That would simplify distribution and installation for the userâ€”they would get everything they need by installing the extension, and the extension would (obviously) already have access to the data it had stored. However, I'm not sure how sophisticated `WebExtension` UIs can be... Is it possible to use a component library, Tailwind, etc.? And I'm also not sure how well-documented building extensions that have "application" levels of complexity will be.

I suppose the alternative would be to support some kind export from the extensions `storage` to a JSON or some other storage format (maybe SQLite? Could use Prisma in that case...), and then either upload that to a web or desktop app (Q: is it possible to grant a web or desktop application permissions to the extension storage, in order to skip the export-and-open workflow?).

Also wonder if there's anything to be said for having a DB or API for querying the data (in case it becomes very expensive to read from the filesystem, access / mutate in memory, and write back...)... That would then raise questions about whether there needs to be an entire backend, or if it's possible to read directly from the client. Perhaps this can be sidestepped by dividing the data by date or session and exporting a ZIP collection instead of raw JSON files... I suppose we should try to Keep It Simple, first, and then go from there.

There are really two main components... something to capture the browsing data (this *has* to be a WebExtension), and then something to *DO* something with it... there's a lot more flexibility here. However, I lean toward keeping everything in just an extension, if that ends up being technically possible and easy enough to figure out...
